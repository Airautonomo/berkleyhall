**Adds pseudo oembed support for PDF documents**

Will embed a PDF file using Google Docs Viewer

Simply include the URL for a PDF document on it's own line, or wrapped in the embed tag like `[embed]http://example.com/file.pdf[/embed]` and the plugin will embed the PDF into the page using the Google Docs Viewer embed code.

The url must end with `.pdf`
